#summary Writing your own XSD2Whatever template

== Templates ==
Templates are groovy scripts designed to work with XSD2Whatever.  The generator requires a _classTemplate_ and, optionally, an _enumTemplate_ (if your XSDs contain enumerations).  

The generator handles many features of XSD, but not the complete specification.  It will likely evolve over time to provide more functionality.

For information on groovy template syntax, check out [http://groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy+Templates Groovy Templates]

== Variables ==
When the templates are executed, they are initialized with a set of variables that can be evaluated to produce the desired output.

  * *gVersion* - Version number of the generator
  * *jClass* - Object describing the Java class that was generated via JAXB-XJC.  This object (hopefully) contains all of the information about the XSD entity to generate the desired output.  *jClass* has the following methods (depending on the context):

_note - although this projects diverges from GraniteDS, much of the information on the Granite template engine still apples, and can be a good resource [http://www.graniteds.org/confluence/display/DOC/3.+Gas3+Template+LanguageGas3 Template Language]_
